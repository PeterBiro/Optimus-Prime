# Optimus-Prime

Now, your task is to count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number (n) by using the sieve.

Optimization ideas:

+ You have infinite amount of memory but a slow CPU: you can use as many and as large data structures as you want.
+ You have infinite amount of CPU but limited memory: store as few data as you can in variables while the program runs.
You must create at least a "basic" solution and/or you can submit one or both of the two optimized functions as well. The optimized functions should return the same as the general solution would, there is no change in the specification, only the inside algorithm differs.

You should also create tests for the function(s). If you have learned already about Unit tests you can write them using these, but they are not necessary.

You need to solve this exercise in one language only!
